## Plots (residual mass < 36310 MeV)

All plots are drawn after applying momentum and angular smearing.
At second pad of each plot, ratio between absolute shapes of signal and Z = 17 background is presented.

### Residual mass

![Residual mass](M_residual_SR1_All.pdf)

We can check that cut on residual mass to be smaller than 36310 MeV is applied correctly.

### Momentum

![Proton momentum](P_proton_SR1_All.pdf)
![Outgoing ${\pi}^{+}$ momentum](P_piplus_SR1_All.pdf)

We see that shapes of signal and Z = 17 backgroud events are different at and nearby the peak.

### Momentum balance

![(P(${\pi}^{+}$) - P(p)) / P(${\pi}^{+}$)](P_balance_piplus_p_SR1_All.pdf)
![(P(beam) - P(${\pi}^{+}$)) / P(beam)](P_balance_beam_piplus_SR1_All.pdf)
![(P(beam) - P(p)) / P(beam)](P_balance_beam_p_SR1_All.pdf)

Momentum balance distributions show more similar shapes between signal and Z = 17 background than momentum plots.

### Q^2

![Q square](Q_square_SR1_All.pdf)

Q^2 distributions show that shape between signal and Z = 17 are almost same where Q^2 is in [0.15 ${GeV}^{2}$, 1 ${GeV}^{2}$] range.
