# Definition of Q_square

We check the Lorentz invariant ${Q}^{2}$ to study the scattering
```
Particle q_4vec = beam - piplus.at(1);
Q_square = (-pow(q_4vec.E(), 2) + pow(q_4vec.P(), 2))
```

## Q squre distributions

${Q}^{2}$ distribution of signal and Z = 17 background without smearing.

${Q}^{2}$ distribution of signal and Z = 17 background after smearing.

We observe a bit wider shape after applying smearing.
