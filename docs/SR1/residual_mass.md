# Definition of residual mass

We reconstruct 4-vector of residual nuclei using beam, outgoing ${\pi}^{+}$ and proton.  
```
${X}^{'}$ = beam - Ar_target(at rest) - ${\pi}^{+}$ - proton
```

## Residual mass distribution before smearing

![](residual_mass_no_smear.png)

We observe Z = 17 bkg (Cl with different atomic mass) at just above signal events.  
So, we can expect that overlap between signal and bkg â€¨after smearing will be dominated by Z = 17 bkg.
